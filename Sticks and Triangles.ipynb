    "Assume without loss of generality that we have a stick with endpoints at $0$ and $1$. The positions of the cuts we make to the stick will then be uniformly distributed between $0$ and $1$. Let $l$ be the position of the leftmost cut and $r$ the position of the rightmost cut. The lengths of each segment, will then be $l$, $r-l$ and $1-r$. While it isn't overly complicated to find a solution using convolutions of uniform random variables, we will use simulation here to estimate the probability of being able to form the triangle.\n",

    "**Remark:** we can form a triangle from the segments iff no segment is longer than the sum of the lengths of the other two segments. Therefore, for a stick of length $1$ the length of each segment must be less than $0.5$.\n",
