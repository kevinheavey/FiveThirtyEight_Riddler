    "\n",
    "Twenty ghostbusters are on their annual camping retreat. Two of them, Abe and Betty, have discovered that another pair, Candace and Dan, are in fact ghosts posing as ghostbusters. Abe and Betty hatch a plan: When all 20 campers are sitting in a circle around the campfire, Abe will fire his proton pack at Candace, and Betty will simultaneously fire her proton pack at Dan, annihilating the ghosts. However, if two proton streams cross, it means the end of all life on Earth.\n",

    "Two chords are created from random endpoints on the circle of radius $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, instead of thinking of four random points on a circle, it is more useful to think of any four distinct points on a circle randomly paired off with each other. There are three different ways you can pair off these points: one way will cause the chords to intersect, the other two will not. No pairing is more likely than another pairing, so the probability that the chords will intersect (the streams will cross) is $1/3$."
